#generating Bunch of images with different style in deltaV with no external imports
Going throught the limitation of the Agentverse(and deltaV) we have integrated an agent that can generate images from text

We are using stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0 api to generate the image 
using imgbb to store the image temporarly
